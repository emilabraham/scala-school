CASE CLASSES
____________

What is the difference between case class and a normal class?
Case classes have a default == method
Able to recursively pattern match on them and their sub-classes
Case classes are Serializable. Normal classes are not.



PARTIALLY APPLIED FUNCTIONS
___________________________
Functions that create functions, where some of the arguments are pre-applied. Basically, you fill in some arguments already.


PARTIAL FUNCTIONS
_________________
Created with an isDefinedAt method, which is a check on whether or not the function should be applied with the apply method

IMPLICITS
_________
These are cool. This is about wrapping already existing classes with additional functionality. For example, creating an isOdd method for Int.

But they are confusing as hell. Look this exercise over. There were a few that I couldn't get right.
